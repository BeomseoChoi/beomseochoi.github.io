**I am currently seeking a graduate program where I can further develop my expertise in deep learning and apply it to computer vision, with a particular focus on generative models and image editing.**

I'm a highly motivated student in Deep Generative Model and a particular interest in image editing. I graduated from Daejeon University **with a GPA of 4.5**, where I developed my interest in artificial intelligence and deep learning.

During my undergraduate studies, **I gained over two years of research experience** at the Computing & Control Lab. (CNCL) under the supervision of Professor Hongjun Kim. My research focused on time-series analysis for predicting lung function. This work led to **the publication of a paper titled `LSTM-Based Time Series Forecasting of Pulmonary Function Test for COPD Early Diagnosis` in The Journal of Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences (Scopus).**
